## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Repo for Getting and Cleaning Data project: It contains R script, codebook, and tidy data set of the project.

## Files

CodeBook.md: a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the tidy data set.

run_analysis.R: R script that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


tidydataset.txt: the output generated from R script
